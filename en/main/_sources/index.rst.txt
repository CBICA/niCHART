###############################################

.. warning::
   The documentation and GUI is under active development.
   Statistical and machine learning models will be made available once fully
   validated.


The neuro-imaging brain aging chart **[NiBAχ]** is a comprehensive solution to
analyze standard structural and functional brain MRI data across studies.
**[NiBAχ]** and the associated pre-processing tools implement computational
morphometry, functional signal analysis, quality control, statistical
harmonization, data standardization, interactive visualization, and extraction
of expressive imaging signatures.
